```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
#take a sad plot and make it better
library(tidyverse) 
library(dsbox)
library(mosaicData) 
staff<-read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
#write_csv(staff, "staff.csv")
#head(staff)
#how to convert wide format to long format
staff_long<-staff %>% pivot_longer(cols = -faculty_type, names_to = "year")%>% mutate(value=as.numeric(value))
#staff_long
#plot staff_long
ggplot(staff_long, aes(x=year, y=value, color=faculty_type))+
  geom_line()+
  labs(title="Instructional staff at UBC", x="Year", y="Number of staff")+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
#there is only one observation for a combination of each faculty type and each year in the plot above
#to address this, we can use the group argument in the aes function
